In this repository, you can find some of my personal projects:

1. [Exploratory Data Analysis on data from ENEM 2020](https://github.com/LeonardoGoncRibeiro/PersonalProjects/blob/main/01_ENEM_EDA.ipynb): In this file, I perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on data from ENEM 2020. I draw some important inferences of the sample of students who signed up and attended to the test. Here, we were able to use visualization tools and hypothesis tests 
to show that there is a clear inequality, and that interventions may be needed.
